<h4>Description</h4>
This is the training project, on which I was learning how to create news app agregator.
This app was designed using the MVC method(model-view-controller). Also I work with third-party service https://newsapi.org/ to have the opportunity to find necessery news. For work with that service I use my knowledge of AJAX requests.
